# Python API for euphoria.io
An API that wraps sockets in a nice interface. Note: this library is only compatible with python3.

# How to set up
At the moment, there are no setup things. So, until I make one, here are some basic instructions on how to download this library and run the example:

```bash
#If you don't want to use pip you can try downloading the client from the webpage at
#https://pypi.python.org/pypi/websocket-client
pip3 install websocket-client

git clone https://github.com/jedevc/euphoria-python.git

cd euphoria-python
python3 example.py
```

# Quick use
Create a new class which extends all the classes that you need to access from your bot. Hopefully my code is clean enough to make it simple enough to read.

For a basic example of a hello bot, look in example.py.
