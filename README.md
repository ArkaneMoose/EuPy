# Python API for euphoria.io
An API that wraps sockets in a nice interface.

# How to set up
At the moment, there are setup things. So, until I make one, just download and put the euphoria folder in your project. Note: this library is only compatible with python3 at the moment. I will work on making it available for python2 at some point in the future.

# Quick use
Extend one of the Room classes, prefereably the one that has the closest functionality to what you need. Them simply override the methods of the one that you want.

For a basic example of a hello bot, look in example.py.
